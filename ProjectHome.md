# About #
This is a project aims to develop a special **3D printer** made of **LEGO Mindstorms(R)** pieces. Inspired by the GNU [RepRap 3D Printer](http://www.reprap.org/) (open-source based 3D printer) and Arthur Sacek's Milling Machine, this project combines both techniques  resulting in a machine that, even though  resembles the RepRap design, it drills floral foam so as to make  three dimensional objects. However, LEGO, as modular components, make the machine hybrid, with the capability of placing a specialized [extruder](Extruder.md) instead of the milling bit.

The software is written in Java (implementing LeJOS NXJ API)

# Ideas #
  1. Use an RPi as a control unit and rewrite the code in python. Use nxt-python for direct commanding
  1. Make alternate extruders
  1. Improve bed
